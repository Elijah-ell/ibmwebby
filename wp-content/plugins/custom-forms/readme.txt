The Custom Forms is a powerful add-on which allows you to easily create new custom fields in a simplest possible way - drag & drop.

== Description ==

Every piece of information collected form your clients via Custom Forms can be exported as PDF. Also, this add-on integrates well with our CSV Add-on. The add-on will simplified the data transfer to other systems by providing a data exporter that outputs CSV formatted files.
